This package is currently being developed and subsequent updates will be
published in this repository, following the principles of open
development. Major achievments will be tagged in the [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/Gait_Analysis/releases).
This project uses [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) to develop, test,
document, and publish its source code.

## Project status

The main goal of this project is to foster gait analysis of rodents
using 3D tracking data as input. However, the project is still in a very
initial state and the current implementation focuses solely on a very
customized analysis of 2D tracking data. Future versions will gradually
increase the implemented analysis methods and their generalizability.

## Install

So far only tested for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.5).

### conda:

``` sh
conda install -c dennis_segebarth gait_analysis
```

### pip:

``` sh
pip install gait_analysis
